# Explanation:
The project is to analyze the TED talks videos data from Kaggle. There are several fields can be shown from the files. Currently, I use it to categorize the speakers and check what kind of speakers can the most views.

In the implementation, I use LDA model from the gensim package to help me to suit the proper categories of presenters. In the future, I will dedicate to analyzing other features of the data and find other interesting solutions.
